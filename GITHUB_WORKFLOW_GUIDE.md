# GitHub Workflow

This guide explains how we use GitHub for collaboration, project management, and code reviews. It covers the key principles of our workflow: managing issues, creating branches, making commits, and submitting pull requests (PRs).

The document provides a complete overview of how to work with our GitHub template, including best practices for handling issues, reviewing code, and contributing to project development.

## Issues

A GitHub issue is a way to track work, bugs, tasks, or feature requests in a repository. It provides a centralized place to plan, discuss, assign, and manage work. You can organize work hierarchically by creating a parent Issue for a larger task and linking sub-issues for smaller, related tasks. This allows you to easily track progress and browse the full hierarchy of work to be done.

## Issue Hierarchy

Our workflow follows a three-tier hierarchy for better organize and manage work:

```

**Hierarchy Overview:**
```
Epic → Feature → Task
```

### Issue Templates
Each repository will be configured with Issue templates of these main types: Epic, Feature, Task, and Bug. The following sections explain all the Issue templates, their contents, and how to use them effectively.

#### Epic Template
- **Purpose**: Large-scale business initiatives spanning multiple months/quarters
- **Scope**: Contains multiple features and defines strategic direction
- **Owner**: Product managers, team leads, stakeholders

## Assigning issues and pull requests to other GitHub users

Assignees clarify who is working on specific issues and pull requests.

## Closing an issue

To keep our issue tracker clear and transparent, please follow these rules when closing issues:

- **Closing through a Pull Request:** If an issue is linked in a PR using GitHub keywords such as `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`, it will be automatically closed once the PR is merged.
- **Manual closing (required action):** If you close an issue without a PR merge, you must leave a comment explaining the reason (e.g., resolved elsewhere, duplicate, or won't fix). Always include enough context so that future readers can understand the decision.

## Configuring issue templates for your repository

Use the templates available in the [docs-template repository](https://github.com/rihal-om/docs-template) to set up standardized issue templates for your repository.

### Issue Workflow

1. Creating issue using a template
2. Filling in information
3. Adding a task list/sub task issues to break down work (optional)
4. Adding labels
5. Adding milestones
6. Assigning the issue
7. Adding the issue to a project
8. Submitting your issue

---

## Labels

Labels let you categorize issues, pull requests, and discussions within a repository. They are repository-specific, so changes don't affect other repos.

GitHub also provides default labels in new repositories to support standard workflows.

### Development Area Labels
- `area: fe` - Frontend (UI, components, client-side logic)
- `area: be` - Backend (Server, APIs, database)
- `area: ml` - Machine Learning (Modeling, feature engineering, evaluation)
- `area: mobile/android` - Work related only to Android applications
- `area: mobile/ios` - Work related only to iOS applications
- `area: mobile/both` - Work related to both Android and iOS applications
- `area: security` - Vulnerabilities, audits, fixes

### Category Labels

- `category: design` - Design, wireframes, mockups
- `category: ci/cd` - Deployment scripts, CI/CD, infrastructure
- `category: documentation` - Writing or updating documentation, guides, READMEs
- `category: chores` - Maintenance, housekeeping, or non-feature work
- `category: refactor` - Code restructuring or improvements without adding new functionality

### Module Labels (Customize for your project)
- `module: auth` - Authentication and authorization
- `module: users` - User management
- `module: api` - API and integration
- `module: dashboard` - Dashboard and analytics

**Note:** Module labels should be customized for each project based on its specific architecture and components.

### Special Labels
- `help wanted` - Extra attention or contributions are needed
- `question` - Used when someone is asking for clarification, guidance, or additional information about the project, feature, or issue.

---

## Branches

Whenever you propose a change in Git, you create a new branch. Branch management is an important part of the Git workflow. After some time, your list of branches may grow, so it's a good idea to delete merged or stale branches.

### Branch Naming

When creating a new branch, follow these conventions:

- If the issue is from GitHub:
  - **Prefix with the issue number**: start the branch name with the related issue ID.
  - **Add a short title**: describe the task or feature briefly.
  - **Use lowercase only**.
  - **Use hyphens (`-`) as separators** to avoid underscores or spaces.
  - **Keep it concise**: 3–5 words, clear and descriptive.

- If the issue is from another platform (e.g., Click Up, Linear, Trello, etc.):
  - First, create a corresponding issue in GitHub.
  - Then, follow the same GitHub branch naming rules as above.

**Examples:**
- `890-fix-api`
- `12-fix-button`
- `567-resolve-crash`

**Why this matters:**
- Easy sorting and organization in Git
- Quick issue lookup and traceability
- Better Git history and navigation
- Automated linking between branches and issues

---

## Commit Messages

Git commits are a way to "record changes to a repository". A well-written commit message makes it easier for everyone to understand what changed and why.

**Format:**
```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short summary>
```

### Types
- `feat` → a new feature
- `fix` → a bug fix
- `docs` → documentation only changes
- `style` → code style/formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor` → code restructuring without behavior change
- `perf` → performance improvements
- `test` → adding or updating tests
- `chore` → maintenance tasks (build, tooling, configs, etc.)
- `build` → build system changes or external dependencies
- `ci` → CI/CD configuration or scripts
- `revert` → revert a previous commit

### Scope (optional)
Use when the commit affects a specific area, module, or tool. Examples: `web`, `server`, `docker`, `k8s`, `e2e`, `docs`, `ci`, `deps`, `ml`, `keycloak`.

### Summary
- Use the imperative present tense (`add`, `fix`, `update`, `remove`).
- Write in lowercase.
- Keep it short and clear (≤ 72 characters).

### Examples

**Good commit messages:**
```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support (refs #123)
fix(api): resolve timeout issue (fixes #456)
docs: update installation guide (refs #789)
refactor(db): optimize query performance (refs #234)
test(auth): add login integration tests (refs #567)
chore: update dependencies (refs #890)
```

**Bad commit messages:**
```bash
updated code
changes
wip
fix
update
```

### Linking Commits to Issues

Always reference the related issue in your commit message:
- `refs #123` - References the issue
- `fixes #123` - Closes the issue when merged to main
- `closes #123` - Closes the issue when merged to main

---

## Pull Requests

A pull request is to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.

### Pull Request Template

A Pull Request template ensures consistency, clarity, and faster reviews. It guides developers to provide all necessary information for reviewers and maintainers.

**Template includes:**
- **Title:** A brief, descriptive summary of the pull request.
- **Description:** Explain what the PR does, why it's needed, and any relevant context.
- **Related Issues:** Link to any related issues, tickets, or Epics.
- **Type of Change:** Specify the type of change (e.g., Bug fix, Feature, Refactor, Documentation).
- **Changes Made:** List the main changes, additions, or deletions introduced by the PR.
- **Testing:** Describe how reviewers can test the changes, including steps or environments.
- **Checklist:** Optional verification items (e.g., code linted, tests passed, documentation updated).
- **Screenshots:** Optional visual aids, logs, or images to clarify the changes.

### PR Requirements
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single task or feature.
- Use clear, concise language in descriptions and titles.
- Link all related issues for traceability.
- Update the PR if changes are requested during review.
- Add appropriate labels.
- Fill out PR template completely.
- Request at least one reviewer.

### PR Checks (Automated)
- Semantic PR title validation
- Commit author validation
- Auto-size labeling based on changes
- Linting and code style checks
- Automated tests
- Build verification

### PR Process
1. Create PR from a feature branch
2. Auto-assigned size label
3. Semantic validation runs
4. Automated checks execute
5. Code review process
6. Address feedback
7. Approval and merge
8. Automatic issue closure (if linked)

### Linking a pull request to an issue using a keyword

You can link a pull request to an issue by using a supported keyword in the pull request's description or in a commit message.

**Keywords:**
- `close`, `closes`, `closed`
- `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`
- `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`

These can be followed by colons or written in uppercase. For example:
- `Closes: #10`
- `CLOSES #10`
- `CLOSES: #10`

> **Note:** Only manually linked pull requests can be manually unlinked. To unlink an issue that you linked using a keyword, you must edit the pull request description to remove the keyword.
