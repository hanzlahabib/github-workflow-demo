## üìú Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of GitHub workflows
- Familiarity with YAML syntax

### Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub or use GitHub CLI
   gh repo fork your-org/github-workflow-best-practices
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-workflow-best-practices.git
   cd github-workflow-best-practices
   ```

3. **Set up upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-org/github-workflow-best-practices.git
   ```

4. **Verify your setup**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show both origin (your fork) and upstream (original repo)
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use the following branch naming patterns:

- **Features**: `feature/short-description`
- **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/short-description`
- **Documentation**: `docs/short-description`
- **Maintenance**: `chore/short-description`

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow our coding standards
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation

3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```
   
   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for adding tests

4. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use our PR template
   - Provide clear description
   - Link to related issues
   - Request appropriate reviewers

## üêõ Issue Guidelines

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Check documentation** to ensure it's not already covered
3. **Use the appropriate template** (Bug Report, Feature Request, or Task)

### Issue Types

#### Bug Reports
- Use the bug report template
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Include environment details
- Add relevant logs or screenshots

#### Feature Requests
- Use the feature request template
- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Provide use cases and acceptance criteria
- Consider alternative solutions

#### Tasks
- Use the task template
- Break down complex work into smaller tasks
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Estimate effort required

### Issue Labels

Issues will be automatically labeled, but you can suggest:
- **Priority**: `priority: low/medium/high/critical`
- **Type**: `type: bug/feature/task/documentation`
- **Component**: Based on affected area
- **Size**: Based on estimated effort

## üîÄ Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

- [ ] **Self-review** your code changes
- [ ] **Run tests** and ensure they pass
- [ ] **Update documentation** if needed
- [ ] **Check code style** compliance
- [ ] **Link to related issue** using keywords like "Closes #123"

### PR Requirements

1. **Use our PR template** - Fill out all relevant sections
2. **Provide clear description** - Explain what changes you made and why
3. **Keep changes focused** - One feature/fix per PR
4. **Write good commit messages** - Follow conventional commit format
5. **Update tests** - Add or modify tests for your changes
6. **Update documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes

### PR Size Guidelines

- **XS (< 50 lines)**: Simple bug fixes, documentation updates
- **S (50-200 lines)**: Small features, minor refactoring
- **M (200-500 lines)**: Medium features, significant changes
- **L (500-1000 lines)**: Large features (consider breaking down)
- **XL (> 1000 lines)**: Should be avoided (break into smaller PRs)

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass
2. **At least one reviewer** approval required
3. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
4. **Squash commits** if requested before merge

## üíª Coding Standards

### YAML Files

```yaml
# Use 2 spaces for indentation

        run: echo "Use descriptive names"
```

### Documentation

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Workflow Testing

1. **Validate YAML syntax** before committing
2. **Test workflows** in your fork before submitting
3. **Verify template rendering** for issue and PR templates
4. **Check label configuration** syntax

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Validate YAML files
yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml
yamllint .github/labels.yml

# Test workflow syntax (if you have act installed)
act -n

# Validate GitHub CLI commands
gh auth status
gh label list --repo your-fork/repo-name
```
