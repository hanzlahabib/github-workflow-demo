cd your-repo

# Verify your Git configuration
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

### 2. Familiarize Yourself with the Project Structure

git branch -a

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

### 3. Review Project Documentation

- [ ] Read the README.md
- [ ] Review CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Check existing issues and PRs to understand patterns

## üîÑ Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)

1. **Update your local repository**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Review your assigned issues**
   - Visit: `https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues/assigned/@me`
   - Check the project board for your tasks

3. **Update project board**
   - Move completed items to "Done"
   - Move current work to "In Progress"
   - Add comments on any blockers

### During Development

Follow the workflow: **Issue ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí Code ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge**

## üìù Creating Issues

### When to Create an Issue

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing a new feature
- Planning a task or improvement
- Documenting technical debt

### How to Create an Issue

1. **Navigate to Issues**
   ```
   Repository ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí New Issue
   ```

2. **Choose the Right Template**
   - **üêõ Bug Report** - For reporting bugs
   - **‚ú® Feature Request** - For new features or enhancements
   - **üìù Task** - For general work items

3. **Fill Out Required Fields**

   **For Bug Reports:**
   - Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Component affected (Frontend/Backend/API/etc)
   - Environment (Production/Staging/Dev)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable

   **For Feature Requests:**
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Alternative approaches
   - Use cases
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Effort estimate (XS/S/M/L/XL)

   **For Tasks:**
   - Clear description
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Dependencies
   - Estimated effort

4. **Submit and Verify**
   - Issue is auto-labeled with `type` and `status: triage`
   - Issue appears on the project board
   - Team leads will review and prioritize

## üíª Working on Tasks

### Step 1: Pick an Issue

```bash
# Find an issue from the board or issues list
# Make sure the issue is:
# - Assigned to you
# - In "Todo" or "Ready" status
# - Has clear acceptance criteria
```

### Step 2: Create a Branch

**Branch Naming Convention: `{issue-id}-short-description`**

```bash
# Start with the issue number for easy tracking
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b 123-add-user-authentication
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b 456-implement-dashboard

# Bug fix branch
git checkout -b 789-fix-login-error

# Hotfix branch
git checkout -b 999-hotfix-security-patch
```

### Step 3: Make Your Changes

```bash
# Write your code
# Test thoroughly
# Follow coding standards

# Check what you've changed
git status
git diff
```

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes

**Commit Message Convention:**

```
type(scope): description (refs #issue-number)
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 support (refs #123)"

git commit -m "fix(api): resolve null pointer exception (fixes #456)"

git commit -m "docs: update installation guide (refs #789)"
```

### Step 5: Push Your Branch

```bash
# Push to remote repository
git push origin 123-add-user-authentication

# If this is your first push
git push -u origin 123-add-user-authentication
```

## üîÄ Creating Pull Requests
